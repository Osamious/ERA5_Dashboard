Features to add:

All:

1- Figures are extremely large, they take up the screen space of the entire screen, let's minimize them

2- Add documentation tab that documents all the features

4- If tf nightly is unstable, revert to python 3.12 and get tensorflow


Data Fetching:

1- Add ability to concatanate/merge files together to overcome download limit from era5 database


Visualization:

1- Make the time slider and entire map sizes such that both can be shown on the screen at the same time.

2- Make time slider update the plot in real time or smooth animation

3- For area files with mutiple variables, add ability to plot them superimposed on each other and toggle them on/off

4- For spatial maps, add a short description for each spatial plot and what data it best represents in the contexet of this project.

5- Range selector for spatial files: user will select a time range for the data in a spatial file, using this time range, the dashboard will calculate three things: maximum, minimum, and average value for each grid point and display 3 seperate plots to visualize each, plots will update as time range is changed. This feature is to help visualize how max,min, and average values change across time.


Report:

1- ✅ COMPLETED: Expand capabiltiy of report tab to write a few paragraphs on the analysis it makes, explaining the report, highlighting anything interesting, and draw conclusions/predictions - LLM-generated climate summary section now implemented with trend analysis, climate implications, and recommendations.

2- ✅ COMPLETED: Add analysis/visualization method that helps users see any significant increase/decrease in the overall variable values - Trend and change analysis implemented with statistical significance testing, trend visualization, and extreme event detection.

3- ✅ COMPLETED: Add metrics that help climate researchers understand patterns/trends and find anomalies/abnormal behavior - Climate research metrics implemented including coefficient of variation, anomaly detection, persistence analysis, seasonal patterns, and spatial variability.

4- For files with multiple variabes, analyze them and draw/exclude connections, find patterns and reach conclusions

5- Ability to read multiple files and use data from different files to draw/exclude connections, find patterns and reach conclusions


Prediction:

1- ✅ COMPLETED: Replace IDW model with ConvLSTM for spatial prediction - ConvLSTM now implemented as base spatial model with proper spatio-temporal forecasting capabilities.

2- Add suppport for more paramater optimization methods like grid search while keeping the old ones

3- For files with multiple variables, add support to identify all variables, then add the option to predict each variable independetly or collectively. For independent prediction add checkbox for which variables I want to generate predictions, for collective, give me the option to select what variables I want to be included and linked together in the prediction, otherwise try to find the links and patterns between them automatically and note what you find at the end of the prediction in a nice summary

4- Add advice description when auto-tune is enabled about what values to set for number of trials and time-out

5- Add a description regarding the auto tune button: for each model, what parameter is being optimized

6- rename auto-tune to paramtere optimization

7- The main actual vs predicted plot has a problem with the y-axis, it doesn't use the simple variable name and shows no units.

9- subsmapling for large grids maybe?

10- When model is training, disable parameters settings and add support for stopping mechanism

Didn't work:

8- Loading bar when running auto tune to show progress of prediciotn and parameter optimization

9- Add a timer that counts how long it took for the training to complete
